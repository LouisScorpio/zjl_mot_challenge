## Introduction
This repository contains baseline code for 2019 zhejiang lab cup global AI competition multiple object tracking challenge. We use [yolov3](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) to detect persons and [deep SORT](https://github.com/nwojke/deep_sort) algorithm for tracking. Of course you can use other methods based on automatic tracker initialization for MOT challenge. The code is for baseline only.

## Dependencies
The code can be runnning with Python 3.5. The following dependencies are needed:

- NumPy
- sklearn
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- keras
